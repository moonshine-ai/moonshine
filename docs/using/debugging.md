## Console Logs

The library is designed to help you understand what's going wrong when you hit an issue. If something isn't working as expected, the first place to look is the console for log messages. Whenever there's a failure point or an exception within the core library, you should see a message that adds more information about what went wrong. Your language bindings should also recognize when the core library has returned an error and raise an appropriate exception, but sometimes the logs can be helpful because they contain more details.

## Input Saving

If no errors are being reported but the quality of the transcription isn't what you expect, it's worth ruling out an issue with the audio data that the transcriber is receiving. To make this easier, you can pass in the `save_input_wav_path` option when you create a transcriber. That will save any audio received into .wav files in the folder you specify. Here's a Python example:

```bash
moonshine-voice transcribe --options='save_input_wav_path=.'
```

This will run test audio through a transcriber, and write out the audio it has received into an `input_1.wav` file in the current directory. If you're running multiple streams, you'll see `input_2.wav`, etc for each additional one. These wavs only contain the audio data from the latest session, and are overwritten after each one is started. Listening to these files should help you confirm that the input you're providing is as you expect it, and not distorted or corrupted.

## API Call Logging

If you're running into errors it can be hard to keep track of the timeline of your interactions with the library. The `log_api_calls` option will print out the underlying API calls that have been triggered to the console, so you can investigate any ordering or timing issues.

```bash
moonshine-voice transcribe --options='log_api_calls=true'
```
